        location for the WWT-hosted version of the app â€” although at the moment

    OK. So.

    The Python code running in this process is communicating with the WWT
    JavaScript frontend, which is running in another process that is possibly on
    the other side of the internet. Various WWT operations such as loading
    imagery need that frontend to perform web requests and the like. So much of
    what we want to do is just inherently asynchronous.

    Which is OK! We require sufficiently new Python that we can rely on
    async/await being available, and the Jupyter infrastructure is extremely
    async-friendly.

    Except that we have a problem. When our process is running inside Jupyter,
    all code executions are inherently triggered by "shell messages" telling the
    kernel to run some code. Shell messages are also used for Jupyter's "comms"
    infrastructure, which is how kernels get updates from the WWT frontend(s)
    about things that are going on. The problem is that the Python Jupyter
    kernels only process shell messages *sequentially*: while message evaluation
    can be asynchronous, they can't be evaluated simultaneously. So if we've got
    asynchronous user code that's attempting to do stuff with pywwt, we can't
    receive any updates from WWT while that code is running. This fundamentally
    breaks our ability to allow users to write code that interacts with WWT
    asynchronously.

    Our mega-hack solution is to allow some shell messages to be marked for
    "expedited" processing. We hack the kernel so that such messages can be
    processed even while another shell message -- such as an execution request
    -- is being dealt with. This breaks the logjam.

    Expedited messages have the following structure:

    {
        'content': {
            '_pywwtExpedite': true
        }
    }

    This allows ipywidgets custom messages to be marked for expedited
    processing, which we need for our ipywidget support.

    To amp up the debugging spew so that you can see what's going on inside
    the kernel (which is captured in the Jupyter Server output), run:

    ```
    import ipykernel.kernelbase
    ipykernel.kernelbase.Kernel.instance().log.setLevel('DEBUG')
    ```
