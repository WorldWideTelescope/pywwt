pywwt: The AAS WorldWide Telescope from Python/Jupyter
======================================================

About
-----

The pywwt_ package is the official toolkit for accessing the AAS_ `WorldWide
Telescope`_ (WWT) from Python. WWT is a free, open-source tool for visually
exploring humanityâ€™s scientific understanding of the Universe. It includes a
sophisticated 4D WebGL rendering engine and a cloud-based web service for
sharing and visualizing terabytes of astronomical data. WWT is brought to you
by the non-profit `American Astronomical Society`_ (AAS), the major
organization of professional astronomers in North America, and the `.NET
Foundation`_.

With pywwt_ you can:

* Visualize and explore astronomical data interactively in the `Jupyter and
  JupyterLab`_ environments through an HTML widget
* Do the same in standalone applications with a Qt_ widget
* Load data from common astronomical data formats (e.g. `AstroPy tables`_)
  into WWT
* Control a running instance of the WWT Windows application
