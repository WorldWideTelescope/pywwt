pywwt: The AAS WorldWide Telescope from Python
==============================================

The pywwt package is the official toolkit for accessing the AAS_ `WorldWide
Telescope`_ (WWT) from Python. WWT is a free, open-source tool for visually
exploring humanityâ€™s scientific understanding of the Universe. It includes a
sophisticated 4D WebGL rendering engine and a cloud-based web service for
sharing and visualizing terabytes of astronomical data. WWT is brought to you
by the non-profit `American Astronomical Society`_ (AAS), the major
organization of professional astronomers in North America, and the `.NET
Foundation`_.

With pywwt you can:

* Visualize and explore astronomical data interactively in the `Jupyter and
  JupyterLab`_ environments through an HTML widget
* Do the same in standalone applications with a Qt_ widget
* Load data from common astronomical data formats (e.g. `AstroPy tables`_)
  into WWT
* Control a running instance of the WWT Windows application

This package is under active development. If you run into any issues or would
like to see a new feature added, please ask! See the `Getting
help`_ section below.


Quick start
-----------

The quickest way to see what the pywwt can do is to try it out live, which you
can do straight in your browser with our cloud-based Jupyter notebooks. Here
are some examples:

* `Explore which parts of the sky have been observed by the NASA K2 mission
  <http://binder.wwt-forum.org/v2/gh/WorldWideTelescope/pywwt-notebooks/master?urlpath=lab/tree/first-tutorials/kepler2_fovs.ipynb>`_
* `Plot earthquake data on the surface of the Earth <http://binder.wwt-forum.org/v2/gh/WorldWideTelescope/pywwt-notebooks/master?urlpath=lab/tree/first-tutorials/planet_layers.ipynb>`_
* `Animate the motions of the Solar System planets in 3D <http://binder.wwt-forum.org/v2/gh/WorldWideTelescope/pywwt-notebooks/master?urlpath=lab/tree/first-tutorials/solar_system_simulation.ipynb>`_

For more examples or to suggest your own, visit the `pywwt-notebooks
repository`_ on GitHub.

*Note: it is usually fast to launch these notebooks, but if the code has been
recently updated, you may have to wait a few minutes for the backing software
images to be rebuilt.*
