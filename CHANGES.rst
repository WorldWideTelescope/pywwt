0.9.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- No changes yet.

0.8.0 (2020-04-03)
------------------

- Added a ``name`` attribute for table and image layers, and set layer names
  to unique IDs if not specified. [#235]

- Improve performance when changing size parameters for tabular layers. In these
  cases, the performance is e.g. more than 1000x better for a 50,000 row
  dataset. [#224]

- Improve performance when changing colormap parameters for tabular
  layers, for a subset of colormaps. In these cases, the performance
  is e.g. more than 1000x better for a 50,000 row dataset. [#223]

- Added a ``cmap`` parameter on image layers to control the colormap. [#244]

- Incorporate time series behavior for data layers; add method that
  returns current time in the viewer. [#187]

- Drop support for Python 2.7 and now require at least Python 3.6. [#259]

- Fix compatibility with Jupyter 2.0. [#260]

0.7.0 (2019-09-20)
------------------

- You can now save your WWT views as interactive figures to be used in journal
  articles! (Actually, they're just standalone web pages, so they can be used
  anywhere you've got a web server.) This feature is new so it will still have
  some rough edges â€” keep your eyes open for improvements. And the docs haven't
  been written yet :-( [#215, #227]

- Relatedly, there is new first-draft support for interactive controls for
  image layers through the ``image.controls`` meta-property. This will also
  evolve over the next few releases. [#217]

- Initial support for data layers with Cartesian (XYZ) rather than spherical
  (lat, lon, alt) coordinates. [#190]

- Fix compatibility with the JupyterLab 1.0.x series. [#216, #219, #221]

- Expose all available imagery layers. [#220]

- Validate coordinate frame names used with tabular data layers. [#195]

- Fix the widget ``reset`` method . [#212]

- Various improvements to CI infrastructure, docs, landing pages, etc. [#218,
  #225, #228, #229, #230]

0.6.1 (2019-06-10)
------------------

- Fixed issues when calling ``reset()``. [#212]

- Fixed resizing issues in Jupyter Lab. [#216]

- Fixed server URL when using Jupyter Lab. [#219]

0.6.0 (2019-05-29)
------------------

- Implement support for color-coding and scaling points in layers according
  to table attributes. [#183]

- Removed ``load_fits_data`` and added ``layers.add_image_layer`` instead,
  which provides control over the image stretch, and renamed
  ``layers.add_data_layer`` to ``layers.add_table_layer``. [#188, #201]

- Added support for drag and drop events in Qt widget. [#202]

- Added support for ``get_center`` for the Jupyter widget, and add a new
  ``get_fov`` method to get the current field of view. [#206]

- Fixed compatibility with notebook>=5.7.6 which requires mime
  types for served files to be correct. [#192, #208]

- Fixed display of table layers on Windows. [#207]

0.5.3 (2019-01-16)
------------------

- Exposed option to turn off large-scale SDSS data in 3D mode, improving
  performance. [#176]

- Make sure default altitude type is set correctly. [#176]

0.5.2 (2019-01-08)
------------------

- Added instructions for using Jupyter Lab. [#170]

- Fixed ``set_view('Mars')``. [#171]

- Fixed issue with layers not appearing under certain circumstances. [#173]

0.5.1 (2019-01-04)
------------------

- Fixed a bug that caused layers to not immediately update when updating
  data. [#167]

- Fixed a bug that caused some columns to be pre-assigned to e.g. size_att
  based on column name. [#167]

0.5.0 (2019-01-04)
------------------

- Fixed issues with zooming using trackpad/scroll wheel. [#166]

- Added support for customizing the layer marker type (``marker_type``), the
  option to specify whether the marker size is absolute or relative to the
  screen (``marker_scale``), and the option to show points on the far side of
  an object (``far_side_visible``). [#165]

- Fixed a bug that caused issues with the distance/altitude of points when not
  centered on the Earth. [#165]

0.4.1 (2018-12-23)
------------------

- Work around an issue with getting base URLs on e.g. mybinder.

- Improvements to documentation. [#160, #164]

0.4.0 (2018-12-20)
------------------

- Added keyboard shortcuts for movement in-viewer. [#81]

- Disable crosshairs by default. [#157]

- Added ``pause_time`` and ``play_time`` for controlling time and make it
  possible to control the rate of passage of time. [#146, #152]

- Added support for displaying fields of view for common telescope. [#102]

- Added ``minor_orbits`` and ``stars`` attributes to control the visibility
  of minor orbits and stars in solar system mode. [#145]

- Added support for showing tables of data using layers. [#122, #136, #139, #140, #143, #147, #150]
